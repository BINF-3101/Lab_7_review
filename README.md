# Lab_8

As a significant portion of your grade, you will be generating a scientific paper describing the analyses we have done in the lab. In preparation for this, we will be collecting and colating the data we will need. 

You will also need to do some reading about your species and the gene you are studying. I have collected species descriptions for each of your species. 

## Step 1 - Review your results

Take a look through your previous labs and answer the following questions

**GENOME ASSEMBLY STATISTICS**

### Question 1 

What size k-mer was determined for your genome assembly?

### Question 2

What was the total length of your genome?

### Question 3

What was the N50 of your genome?

### Question 4 

How many contigs were in your filtered genome?

**GENOME ANNOTATION STATISTICS**

### Question 5

What proportion of your BUSCO genes were Missing, Fragmented, Duplicated or Complete & Single copy?

### Question 6

How many genes were annotated in your genome annotation (use the **clear** version)
