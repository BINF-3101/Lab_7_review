# Lab_7

As a significant portion of your grade, you will be generating a talk and two summary assignments based on the lab. In preparation for this, we will be collecting and collating the data we will need. 

You will also need to read about your species and the gene you are studying. I have collected species descriptions for each species. 

## Step 1 - Review your results

Take a look through your previous labs and answer the following questions.

**GENOME ASSEMBLY STATISTICS**

### Question 1 

What size k-mer was determined for your genome assembly?

### Question 2

What was the total length of your genome?

### Question 3

What was the N50 of your genome?

### Question 4 

How many contigs were in your filtered genome?

### Question 5

How well do you feel your genome was assembled? The scale ranges from very poorly assembled, to a high of assembled to the chromosome level. Why do you think this? 

**GENOME ANNOTATION STATISTICS**

### Question 6

What proportion of your BUSCO genes were Missing, Fragmented, Duplicated or Complete & Single copy?

### Question 7

How many genes were annotated in your genome annotation?

### Question 8

How well do you feel your genome was annotated? Why do you think this?



## Step 2 - Review your species description

I've collected species descriptions for each of your species. They are linked here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dMQB6ykYhzzFyWtFi-jBCXJQd3Yk2UCLWxDkSXm-Gk4/edit?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TOGhlm-pL4MrXHkbN7wDOTokor6p2s__?usp=sharing) 

Read through your species description and answer the following questions.

Some yeast prefer to reproduce asexually while others actively produce sexual offspring. In yeast they form a special spore called an **ascospore**. An ascospore is a sexually produced fungal spore formed within an ascus of ascomycetes. Ascospores have a haploid number of chromosomes and are formed by meiosis of the diploid zygote that results when the nuclei of sexually compatible hyphae fuse together.

### Question 9 

Has your species name been updated? If so, what is the old name of your species?

### Question 10 

Does your species form Ascospores?

### Question 11

Where (on what substrates/environment/animal) have strains of your species been found? If there are many listed, pick 3 to report. If the origin is "unknown" report that as well. 

### Question 12 

Is there any geographic information about where your species was found? If so, list up to 3 countries/locations where the species was found. 

### Question 13 

List one other thing you learned/found interesting in your yeast species.

### Question 14

Google your species name. Is there any additional information there? List one additional resource that includes your species (can be a link or a file).
