# Lab_8

As a significant portion of your grade, you will be generating a scientific paper describing the analyses we have done in the lab. In preparation for this, we will be collecting and colating the data we will need. 

You will also need to do some reading about your species and the gene you are studying. I have collected species descriptions for each of your species. 

## Step 1 - Review your results

Take a look through your previous labs and answer the following questions

**GENOME ASSEMBLY STATISTICS**

### Question 1 

What size k-mer was determined for your genome assembly?

### Question 2

What was the total length of your genome?

### Question 3

What was the N50 of your genome?

### Question 4 

How many contigs were in your filtered genome?

**GENOME ANNOTATION STATISTICS**

### Question 5

What proportion of your BUSCO genes were Missing, Fragmented, Duplicated or Complete & Single copy?

### Question 6

How many genes were annotated in your genome annotation (use the **clear** version)



## Step 2 - Review your species description

I've collected species descriptions for each of your species. They are linked here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dMQB6ykYhzzFyWtFi-jBCXJQd3Yk2UCLWxDkSXm-Gk4/edit?usp=sharing

Read through your species description and answer the following questions.

Some yeast prefer to reproduce asexually while others actively produce sexual offspring. In yeast they form a special spore called an **ascospore**. An ascospore is a sexually produced fungal spore formed within an ascus of ascomycetes. Ascospores have a haploid number of chromosomes and are formed by meiosis of the diploid zygote that results when the nuclei of sexually compatible hyphae fuse together.

### Question 7 

Does your species form Ascospores?

### Question 8

Where (on what substrates) have strains of your species been found? If there are many listed, pick 3 to report. If the origin is "unknown" report that as well. 

### Question 9 

Is there any geographic information about where your species was found? If so, list up to 3 countries/locations where the species was found. 

### Question 10 

List one other thing you learned/found interesting in your genome.


## Step 3 - Review your gene function

On the second page/sheet of the google sheet you will see links to descriptions of the genes you are studying. hey are linked here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dMQB6ykYhzzFyWtFi-jBCXJQd3Yk2UCLWxDkSXm-Gk4/edit?usp=sharing


### Question 11

What is the descriptive or long name for your gene? 

### Question 12

What pathway(s) is your gene involved in? List up to 3 if there are more. 

### Question 13

List one other thing you learned/found interesting about your gene.
